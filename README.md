# 3D Cityscape From a 2D Top-View Image
- A program that creates a 3D model from a particular type of 2D image using OpenCV and Vpython.
- Determines if the object is a building, bridge, road, grass or water using colour detection.
- Determines the height of the buildings and bridges based on the intensity of the object.

## Libraries required to run the code 
vpython, cv2, numpy

## How to install vpython
Write pip install vpython==7.6.3 in the terminal.

## How to run the program
Type python project.py in the terminal.

## How to use the program
1. The program will ask for a map image to read. We have uploaded some samples to github. sample1.png, sample2.png, sample3.png will work for this. campus.png is the image for the campus map. Images can also be created in MS Paint using the colours corresponding to each element.
2. The program will ask if you want an underground system. If you do, type y and press enter. Otherwise, type n.
3. If you answered y, the program will ask for an underground map. munnels.png is the map of the munnels.
4. The 3D model will pop up in a browser window.
   - You can view it at different angles by right-clicking the model and moving the mouse or sliding on the trackpad.
   - You can drag the model by holding shift and left-clicking the model and moving the mouse or sliding on the trackpad.
   - You can zoom-in or zoom-out by scrolling up or down using the scroll wheel or sliding your fingers away from or towards each other on the trackpad.
